# GADA-Project1

# TECHNOLOGIES USED


This project required the use of an API that provided a Reddit-like back-end. Users are able to sign in, post, comment, and have some control over the data they create. The languages used are HTML, CSS, and Javascipt. AJAX methods were used to make calls to the API.


# APPROACH


This site started out as a test site for myself and my partner. I used it to test out the API because I wasn't as strong she was in creating functions. I needed to create a simple layout for the pages from a map of user actions that I cross-referenced with a list of the functions I mapped out from the project schema. 

After detailing the map of user actions, I mapped out how the user would access these pages. I had buttons and pages that accessed the same functions, which was good for me because I could use the information from the Postman response to build functions. I could also use the site to play around with the layout so that I could understand the functions' usage more easily. I also used one document for the each of the main languages because it was too complicated to understand multiple pages at such a novice level.


# UNSOLVED PROBLEMS AND HURDLES


I couldn't solve the error-checking. I knew how to view it in the console, but I couldn't get the error pages to display when the errors occured. The major hurdle for me, which was what was slowing my partner down, was that I had to do a lot of reading to understand the schema. I also had to read about XML so I could get a clearer understanding of AJAX. I spent the first two days of the project reading about and testing the API with Postman. I had even written out a template of functions so that I could understand how each of our possible actions was actually a benefit [preferred : transaction] of the API.
