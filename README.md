### APPROACH TAKEN
This was the first front-end application I designed, so I wanted it to be something simple. I didn't know how to incorporate multiple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript pages, so I decided to design a project that used one page for each type of functionality. The main portion of the user view is a div that switched based on the function the user needs. It is a basic design, but it afforded more time to build the JavaScript before the deadline.

The layout of the code is intentionally designed as well. This being my first project, I understood that you have to write code so that other people can uderstand it. All my code was structured and commented, so when I had to add the server-side functionality, it was so much easier to do.
