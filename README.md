# ELECTRIC-SHADOWS
### A CHAT APPLICATION USING AN HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT FRONT-END AND A JAVA BACK-END
This is a project that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to access the functionality provided by an API that offers blog-like functionality. Users can make sign-up, and use create and delete functions on posts and comments. There is also the ability to create a profile.


### TECHNOLOGIES USED
* [INTELLIJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - An IDE used for the Java
* [POSTGRESQL](https://www.postgresql.org) An object-relational database system used with SQL
* [MAVEN](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management 
* [ATOM](https://atom.io) - A cool text editor used to write the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
* [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com) - A platform for testing and developing APIs

### APPROACH TAKEN
This was the first front-end application I designed, so I wanted it to be something simple. I didn't know how to incorporate multiple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript pages, so I decided to design a project that used one page for each type of functionality. The main portion of the user view is a div that switched based on the function the user needs. It is a basic design, but it afforded more time to build the JavaScript before the deadline.

The layout of the code is intentionally designed as well. This being my first project, I understood that you have to write code so that other people can uderstand it. All my code was structured and commented, so when I had to add the server-side functionality, it was so much easier to do.
